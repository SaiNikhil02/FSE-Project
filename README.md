## 🌟 Introduction

The '2048 Game' brings the beloved tile-sliding puzzle to your digital device. It's a challenging and addictive game where you'll need to combine matching tiles to achieve the 2048 tile and emerge victorious.

## 🎯 Game Objective

Your goal is to reach the 2048 tile by strategically merging matching tiles on a 4x4 grid. The challenge lies in making the right moves to achieve this without running out of space!

## 📏 Game Rules

- **Tile Merging**: Tiles with the same number merge when they touch, creating a tile with the sum of their values.
- **Limited Moves**: You have a limited number of moves to reach the 2048 tile.
- **Victory and Defeat**: The game is won when you achieve the 2048 tile. If the grid is full, and you can't make a move, the game ends.
